            <h2>Why Networking Matters for UMSI Students</h2>
            <p>
                Networking is not just about “collecting contacts”—it is about building real relationships that can support your learning,
                your career exploration, and your job or internship search. As an MSI or UMSI student, you are already part of a strong
                community of peers, faculty, alumni, and industry partners.
            </p>

                can guide you step by step as you grow your professional network.

            <h2>Steps to Start Making Connections</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Clarify your goal.</strong> Are you exploring careers, preparing for a specific internship search, or
                    seeking advice on transitioning fields?</li>
                <li><strong>Identify people to reach out to.</strong> Start with UMSI alumni, classmates, instructors, 
                    student org leaders, and people you find on LinkedIn or Career Link.</li>
                <li><strong>Send a focused outreach message.</strong> Briefly introduce yourself, share why you are reaching out,
                    and suggest a short 15–20 minute conversation.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare questions.</strong> Use frameworks like TIARA (Trends, Insights, Advice, Resources, Assignments)
                    to guide your informational interview.</li>
                <li><strong>Follow up and keep records.</strong> Send a thank-you message, note what you learned,
                    and stay in touch over time.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Networking FAQ</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Do I need to be extroverted to network?</strong><br>
                    No. Networking can be quiet, thoughtful, and one-on-one. Many UMSI students prefer smaller conversations or written outreach.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Is it okay to reach out to people I do not know?</strong><br>
                    Yes, as long as you are respectful and clear about your intentions. Mention shared connections, programs, or interests when possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>What if I feel like I have “nothing to offer” yet?</strong><br>
                    Your curiosity, perspective, and questions already have value. Over time, you will be able to share resources, introductions, and encouragement in return.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>How do I keep track of my connections?</strong><br>
                    Many students use a simple spreadsheet or document to track names, roles, organizations, dates of conversations, and follow-up notes.
                </li>
