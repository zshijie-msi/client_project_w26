            <h2>Plan a Strategic Internship Search</h2>
            <p>
                Internships are a key part of your UMSI experience. They allow you to apply classroom knowledge,
                explore different roles, and build skills and networks that can lead to full-time opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
                This page focuses on helping you create a clear, manageable search plan so that you do not feel overwhelmed
                by job boards and endless postings.

            <h2>Steps for a Successful Search</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Clarify what you’re looking for.</strong> Identify a few target paths (e.g., UX research, data analysis,
                    product management, librarianship, policy, information consulting).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Build a timeline.</strong> Note early deadlines (e.g., large tech companies) and rolling timelines
                    (e.g., nonprofits, smaller organizations). Give yourself weekly goals instead of only “big” deadlines.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Prepare your materials.</strong> Update your resume and create or refine your LinkedIn profile, portfolio,
                    or writing samples if needed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Use multiple search channels.</strong> Combine Career Link, University Career Center resources, networking,
                    student orgs, faculty, and alumni outreach instead of relying on one job board.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Track applications and follow-ups.</strong> Use a simple spreadsheet or tracker to record where you applied,
                    dates, status, and next steps.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Internship Searches FAQ</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>When should I start applying?</strong><br>
                    Some employers recruit early (even in the fall), while others post closer to the summer. Starting early gives you
                    more time to explore, but it is never “too late” to adjust your strategy with support from CDO.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>How many roles should I apply to?</strong><br>
                    Focus on quality over quantity. It is usually better to submit fewer, tailored applications than many generic ones.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>What if I do not have prior industry experience?</strong><br>
                    Highlight transferable skills from class projects, volunteer work, part-time jobs, research, and student organizations.
                    Employers care about impact and potential, not just titles.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>What if I feel stuck or discouraged?</strong><br>
                    This is very common. Reach out to a Career Coach, talk with peers, and adjust your plan rather than trying to
                    push through alone.
                </li>
